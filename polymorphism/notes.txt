FullCow seemed to be able to override Cow's make sound() method because derived classes (Cow, FullCow) can override the virtual function of the base class (Animal).
In the base and derived classes, makesound() is a virtual function, and override is declared in the derived classes.
When we use a reference to a derived class to call makesound(), the compiler knows to use the makesound() function associated with that derived class.
